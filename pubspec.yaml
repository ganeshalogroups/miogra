publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:    
    - assets/Svg_Images/discount.svg 
    - assets/Svg_Images/   
    - assets/images/                  
    - assets/images/fastx new 1.png                   
    - assets/animations/                   
    - assets/profileicons/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins-ExtraBold

        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
